## Gauntlet Rules (v1.0.3)

### Objective:
Complete all dungeons in the following order using only items that drop during this challenge:
1. **The Shattered Throne**
2. **Pit of Heresy**
3. **Prophecy**
4. **Grasp of Avarice**
5. **Duality**
6. **Spire of the Watcher**
7. **Ghosts of the Deep**
8. **Warlord's Ruin**
9. **Vesper's Host**
10. **Sundered Doctrine**
11. **Piece de resistance: Magnum Opus: Cherry on top: Vault of Glass**

> _There is no requirement to complete each dungeon flawlessly. Each encounter allows unlimited attempts, but once completed, an encounter cannot be replayed._

### Classes:
Restrictions for used subclasses:
- **Character class** is chosen by the participant at the start of the Gauntlet and remains unchanged until the end of the challenge.
- **Subclass** is randomly selected before starting the activity (1 prismatic draw and 2 draws for each other subclass).
- Once drawn, a subclass is permanently removed from the list of possible subclasses for future dungeons.
  - (2 solar + 2 void + 2 arc + 2 stasis + 2 strand + 1 prismatic = 11 subclasses for 11 dungeons :D)
- The **configuration** (aka build) of the drawn subclass is left to the participant's choice.
  - (Using the same build twice, e.g., arc build for Stormtrance, is allowed, but where's the fun in that? ;D)

### Artifact:
- Artifact progression (details TBD).

### Equipment:
Rules regarding the allowed equipment of the Guardian during the Gauntlet:
- **Start**: blue gear (any blue curated roll).
- Enhancing equipment only with loot from completed encounters, non exotic world drops should be ommited,
- **Exotics**:
  - Dungeon exotic is treated as regular dungeon loot and can be used in the challenge (congrats if you got it :D).
    - Due to the fact that exotics in The Shattered Throne, Pit of Heresy and Grasp of Avarice come from quests, we are introducing a rule to use an external program for drawing the weapon: the specific dungeon exotic can be obtained with a 1 in 20 draw (5% chance) using any third-party random generator(there is a Powershell script provided in this repo called exotic-lottery.ps1). On a successful roll, the corresponding exotic can be taken from the collection/vault and used in following dungeons
 - Exotic Engram is the only allowed world drop. Obtaining it requires a series of draws to determine the specific exotic weapon or armor from the world pool (including post-Beyond Light exotic armors - TBD).


### Tips:
1. It's worth looting all possible secret chests - every extra loot is precious.
2. It's worth freeing up some space in the vault, setting sorting to Newest, and remembering the last inserted item before starting the Gauntlet.
